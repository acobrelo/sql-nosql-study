# Relational and Non-relational Databases Study

Read the following articles thoroughly. Practice active reading by taking notes.

-   [NoSQL Databases Explained | MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/nosql-explained)
-   [MongoDB Use Cases](http://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/use-cases/) (click
    through to at least one detailed example)
-   [Why You Sould Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/)

As you read, pay special attention to addressing the following:

-   Identify use cases where relational or non-relational databases are
    appropriate.
-   List three strengths of relational databases.
-   List three strengths of non-relational databases.

After you've finished your study, summarize your notes to the following section
and open a pull request.

Be prepared to share your notes with others before the discussion. Everyone
should have something to contribute.

## Summary

NoSQL:
- Not relational
- Preferable for easily changeable data
- Good for large volumes of data
- Caching is handled differently
- querying is handled differently
- Separated into documents, which are kind of like tables
  - more or less think of it like a blank page, when you want to find something you just
  kind of...query what you know.
- Sharding?
- Relational is better when you know what you want
- Also better if structure is helpful, easier to spot mistakes
